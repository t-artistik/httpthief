= Introduction =

Httpthief was made as a proof of concept. The goal was to make this work, not to provide powerful framework which can be easily hacked. I don't plan to develop this project anymore.


= Details =

Some future goals:
  * httpthief.py complete refactoring.
  * 1x1 white px image blob on HTTP 200
  * option to send XHR instead IMG SRC
  * option to prevent duplicating of records
  * option to store referer from clients http requests.
  * dbname argument in DB class, to allow easily dbname modification (from command line)
  * command line / cli interface.
